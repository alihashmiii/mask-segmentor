# mask-segmentor

Author: Ali Hashmi

The Mathematica notebooks - written for a senior colleague - were used a while back for segmenting drosophila epithelial cells from very noisy images. The parameters for segmentation are determined using a single image and thereafter the batch of images is processed `single or batch segmentation.nb`. The second notebook `mask-correction.nb` is used for correcting discrepancies in the mask.
