# mask-segmentor

The wolfram scripts/notebooks were used a while back for segmenting drosophila epithelia from very noisy images (for a colleague). The parameters for segmentation are determined using a single image and thereafter the batch of images is processed (single or batch segmentation.nb). The second notebook (mask-correction.nb) is used for correcting discrepancies in the mask.
